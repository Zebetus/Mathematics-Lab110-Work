# Mathematics-Lab110-Work
This is a repository for keeping track of all the Mathematics Lab 110 work which i will be doing

This repository is for use by my project group at university and will contain example codes of simple algorithms for running maths problems in R, so unfortunately i wont be able to take any pull requests apart from those people from this group.
